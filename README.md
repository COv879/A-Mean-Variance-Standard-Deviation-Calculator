# A-Mean-Variance-Standard-Deviation-Calculator
A function that returns a list containing 9 digits. It converts the input list into a 3 x 3 Numpy array, and then return a dictionary containing the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum along both axes and for the flattened matrix.

If a list contains less than 9 elements and it's passed into the function, it should raise a ValueError exception with the message: "List must contain nine numbers." The values in the returned dictionary should be lists and not Numpy arrays.
